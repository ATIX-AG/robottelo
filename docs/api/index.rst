API Documentation
=================

This is the Robottelo API documentation. It is mostly autogenerated from the
source code.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    robottelo
    tests

.. Robottelo is a sizeable project, and it is therefore helpful to have some
.. strategy for laying out the API documentation. The strategy employed in this
.. project is simple: make one .rst file to correspond to each directory-level
.. module. Then, insert the following elements into that .rst file, in this
.. order:
..
.. * An `automodule` directive, thus documenting the current directory-level
..   module.
.. * A `toctree` directive with links pointing to each directory-level
..   submodule.
.. * A series of paired headers and `automodule` directives, one for each
..   file-level module in the current directory.
..
.. For a good example of this design, examine `tests.robottelo.rst`.
