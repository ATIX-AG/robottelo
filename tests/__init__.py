"""
This module contains tests both for Satellite and Robottelo itself.

Tests for Robottelo are in the ``robottelo`` module. Those tests are
inward-facing: they help ensure that this codebase is functioning correctly.

Tests for Satellite are in the ``satellite`` module. Those tests are
outward-facing: they help ensure that a Satellite deployment is functioning
correctly.
